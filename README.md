It simplifies organizing and converting photo collections effortlessly. 
With this user-friendly tool, you can select a source folder containing your photos and choose where to save the converted images. 
The program arranges multiple photos into neat collages, enhancing their presentation with borders. It's designed to be intuitive, allowing you to start, stop, and manage conversions easily. Perfect for anyone looking to streamline photo management without technical complexity.
